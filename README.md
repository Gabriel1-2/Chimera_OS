# Project Chimera OS

Project Chimera OS is a minimalist bare-metal operating system designed for RISC-V 64-bit platforms with a vision to integrate an AI-symbiotic reasoning engine directly into the kernel. This project aims to be radically efficient and self-optimizing while providing an intent-based API for future dynamic and AI-driven enhancements.

## Features
- Minimal, assembly-driven core with a lightweight C foundation.
- Physical Page Frame Allocator (PFA) with robust error checking and logging.
- Integrated trap vectors with detailed diagnostics for both Supervisor and Machine modes.
- A new panic routine to log fatal errors and halt the system in unrecoverable situations.
- A clear roadmap for AI-symbiotic improvements and dynamic hot-swapping of kernel routines.

## Roadmap
1. Integrate a basic CLI that communicates with an AI reasoning engine.
2. Implement dynamic code hot-swapping for critical components such as the scheduler and memory allocator.
3. Enhance system diagnostics and automated error recovery mechanisms using AI insights.
4. Develop comprehensive test suites to ensure system reliability.
5. Continuously update documentation and gather community feedback.
